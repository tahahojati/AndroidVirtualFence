Alright there are serveral parts to this: 
Getting push notifications:
    have a service that subscribes to push notifications. 
Take pictures
Play noise
Do strobe lights
Do face recognition
Send to Cloud. 

Do I need an activity or can I just do all of this from a service. 
right now I will do everything in activity and when I like what I have, i see if I can put it into a service. 
ok let's start

1. play sound and strobe light
2. take a picture
3. send the said picture to an api. 
4. setup push notification service.
